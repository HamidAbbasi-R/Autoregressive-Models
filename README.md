# Autoregressive (AR) Time Series Simulation and Forecasting

This project demonstrates the synthesis, estimation, and forecasting of autoregressive (AR) time series. It includes tools for generating stationary AR processes, estimating model parameters, and evaluating forecast quality.

## Features
- **AR Process Simulation**: Generate synthetic time series data using AR models.
- **Parameter Estimation**: Estimate AR coefficients from simulated or real data.
- **Forecasting**: Perform multi-step forecasts with confidence intervals.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Quantify forecast accuracy using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and coverage probability.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `plotly`, `matplotlib`, `streamlit`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HamidAbbasi-R/Autoregressive-Models.git
   cd Autoregressive-Models
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```
